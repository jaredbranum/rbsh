# Rubbish
## A Ruby Shell

Usage: ruby rubbish.rb

Use the shell as you would any shell (bash, zsh, ksh). Lots of things don't work yet. Ruby does, which is pretty sweet. You can do either:

<pre>
echo hi</pre>
or
<pre>
puts 'hi'</pre>

Improvements coming soon (hopefully). Don't replace your default shell quite yet.
